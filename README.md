## Design 

### Wireframes

Before building the site, Balsamiq was utilised to create wireframes of the site. Wireframes were created in order to develop the websites aesthetic and to give an impression of the responsive style across different platforms.

### Colour Schemes

During the design phase of building the site, various sneaker focuesed ecommerece stores were researched. Colours are used sparingly so I decided to adopt this neutral approach aesthetically. 

#FFFFFF white was used for the majority of the background and header. 
#212529  was used for buttons and product cards.
#080808 was used for the footer

### Fonts 

Nunito was used as the primary font across the site. After research into ecommerece fonts, Nunito was chosen for its well-balanced appearance and rounded asaesthetic, which compliments the rounded border radius which features across the site. San-serif was chosen as a backup font, should Nunito fail.

## Deployment 

Gitpod workspace was used to develop this project, utilising the code institute template. The project was committed and pushed to github. The final project is deployed on Heroku. Static and media files are stored AWS S3. 


### Forking The Repository

Forking a repository of this github project will allow a copy of the original repository to be made and any changes to the copy will not affect the original.
To fork a repository:
* Access the GitHub account and find the  repository.
* On the top right of the page click 'fork'. 
* A copy of the repository will be found in in your GitHub account. 

### Cloning The Repository

Cloning a repository downloads an existing Git repository to your local computer. 
In order to do this: 

* Whilst on github, go to the desired github repository.
* Under the repository name click Clone. 
* To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
* Open Git Bash.
* Access the directory you want the clone to be made.
* Type git clone, and then paste and enter the URL you copied.
    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY

* The  local clone will be created.


### Heroku 

Heroku Deployment

*   In Heroku, create a new app
*   Created a unique name and location for the app
*   On the resources tab, provision a new Heroku Postgres database
*   In the settings tab, go to the Config Vars sections and select reveal config vars 
*   *Configure variables  in Heroku
*	In the gitpod workspace, install dj_database_url and psycopg2 using pip3 install
    dj_database_url & pip3 install psycopg2-binary
*   Ensure Heroku installs the apps requirements by using the pip3 freeze > requirements.txt command 
*   In settings.py import dj_database_url
*   Still in settings.py remove the default database and replace with :  
        DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse('YOUR_DATABASE_URL_FROM_HEROKU')
        }
*   Migrate changes with python3 manage.py migrate
*   As this is a new database, the data needs adding to the new database, do this by using the
    command "./manage.py loaddata db.json" in the terminal.
*   Create a new SuperUser for the Postgres database
*   In settings.py remove the datebase and replace with an if statement so that it connects 
    postgres in Heroku and sqlite in version control 
*   if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
        else:
        DATABASES = {
                'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }


*   Create Procfile so that Heroku creates a web dyno so that it will run gunicorn and serve the        Django app. Use freeze > requirements.txt to add this to the requirements. 

*   Inside the Procfile add web: gunicorn shoes_and_more.wsgi:application
*   Disable Heroku collect static
*   Add the Heroku hostname to allowed hosts in settings.py
*   Produce a new Django secret key and add this to the Heroku config variables
*   Set debug to be true only if there's a variable called development in the environment.
*   Add and commit changes, then push to github and Heroku
*   In the deploy tab in Heroku connect the app to Github by clicking Github and search for the     projectâs repository. Once found, click  Enable Automatic Deploys to ensure project is automatically deployed to Heroku as well as github each time itâs pushed
*   In settings.py and ensure the secret key is called from the enviroment using SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')
*   In settings.py set DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ

##Â Amaon Web Service

* In the Access Control List, clock on Everyone (public access), and check List box accept the warning and then save. 

* With the bucket now created navagate to the Identity and Access Management (IAM) through the AWS Management Console. 

* Create a group for our user to live in and name the group. 

* Click Create Policy

* Select import managed policy, then import the AmazonS3FullAccess policy.

* Copy the ARN into the JSON editor. 

* Click on review (appears after tags)

* Add a policy name and description - then click Create Policy. 

* Attach policy to the created group. 

* Download the csv file which is created. 

* In the terminal install Boto3 and Django-storages

* Freeze requirements.txt file

* Add storages to the Installed Apps in settings.py.

* In settings.py add 
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:

    # Cache control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }

    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'sole-society'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-2'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

    # Static and media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'


* In Heroku set the config variables using the variables from the csv file. 

* Remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC from Heroku config variables. 

* In the project file root directory, create a file called custom_storages.py 

* Inside add: 
from django.conf import settings
from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


    class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


    class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION

* Back in AWS create a folder named 'media'.

* Upload media to this folder. 

* This is where project files will be hosted.
