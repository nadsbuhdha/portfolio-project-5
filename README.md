### Colour Schemes

During the design phase of building the site, various sneaker focuesed ecommerece stores were researched. Colours are used sparingly so I decided to adopt this neutral approach aesthetically. 

#FFFFFF white was used for the majority of the background and header. 
#212529  was used for buttons and product cards.
#080808 was used for the footer

### Fonts 

Nunito was used as the primary font across the site. After research into ecommerece fonts, Nunito was chosen for its well-balanced appearance and rounded asaesthetic, which compliments the rounded border radius which features across the site. San-serif was chosen as a backup font, should Nunito fail.
